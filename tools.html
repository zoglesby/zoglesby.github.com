<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, not that I think anyone cares.</p>

		<h2>Computers</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">Macbook Pro:</a> This is a 2010 13 inch Macbook Pro with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 4GB or ram. It has been my main computer since September 2011. My original plan was to install Fedora on it, but when that failed due to EFI issues I started using OS X full time <del>and now I rather enjoy it</del>. I really want to get Fedora working on this thing!</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S">Nexus S:</a> I am a die hard Android users, and the Nexus S has been a great phone for me. I was using a Nexus One before this, but when I moved back to the US I got a contract with T-Mobile and my Nexus One was using AT&T bands. So rather then suffering with the slow data speeds I upgraded to the Nexus S. As nice as the Galaxy Nexus looks, I think I will have to skip this flagship phone, and that is a first for me. (I was also a G1 owner (the ADP1 to be exact)).</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime">Transformer Prime:</a> I had been using a iPad since late 2010, but I have found some aspects of iOS to be far to limiting. When I had an opportunity to upgrade the Prime seemed like the best option. Time with the device has proven that to be a good choice. The hardware is great; I have had no issues with the WiFi like other have reported, and I don't care about GPS on my tablet. The addition of the keyboard dock makes the devices a great little netbook like system for travel. Combined the two with Better Terminal Emulator Pro and the device is unstoppable.
			
		<h2>Web</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.github.com">Github:</a> These guys make version control cool. Github provides a slick web interface for git repositories that make gitweb look like a 1996 geocites page. They also have features like wikis, bug trackers, and site hosting for projects. This blog is actually hosted on github.</p>
		
		<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><a href="http://gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs:</a> Is there another editor? I think not, Emacs is the most complete and advanced editor on the face of the earth. No other application can ever be needed to edit text. EVER!</p>
			<p><a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt:</a> Mutt with offlineimap is the best email productivity system in the world. While GUI email clients are okay some times, mutt offers the best work flow for me, and keeps me focused on my email.</p>
		
		<h2>Mobile</h2>
			<p><a href="http://astrid.com/">Astrid:</a> Astrid is simply the BEST todo management application I have seen for Android, and now that they have a web interface, it's a complete solution. I tried to use Wunderlist for a while but ended up moving back to Astrid, I personally think it is a better product.</p>
			<p><a href="http://tunein.com/">Tunein Radio:</a> I don't listen to a lot of music, but I have one or two radio stations that I really enjoy, unfortunately after a recent move I am unable to listen to them. Tunein allows me to listen to them on my phone or on my computer.</p>
