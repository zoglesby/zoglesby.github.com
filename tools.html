<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, not that I think anyone cares.</p>

		<h2>Computers</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/hp-elitebook-8460p.aspx">HP EliteBook:</a> This laptop is running Fedora 17, and <a href="https://opensource.conformal.com/wiki/spectrwm">spectwm</a>. At work I use this with a Das Keyboard <a href="http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/">Model S Pro</a> and a Logitech wireless mouse.</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_Nexus">Galaxy Nexus:</a> In a long line of Nexus phone is my pocket the Galaxy Nexus is by far the best, it has everything I loved about the Nexus S, but fixes the little things that I did not care for.</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_Pad_Transformer_Prime">Transformer Prime:</a> I had been using a iPad since late 2010, but I have found some aspects of iOS to be far to limiting. When I had an opportunity to upgrade the Prime seemed like the best option. Time with the device has proven that to be a good choice. The hardware is great; I have had no issues with the WiFi like other have reported, and I don't care about GPS on my tablet. The addition of the keyboard dock makes the devices a great little netbook like system for travel. Combined the two with Better Terminal Emulator Pro and the device is unstoppable.
			
		<h2>Web</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.github.com">Github:</a> These guys make version control cool. Github provides a slick web interface for git repositories that make gitweb look like a 1996 geocites page. They also have features like wikis, bug trackers, and site hosting for projects. This blog is actually hosted on github.</p>
		
		<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2:</a> I once was a devoted emacs users, but I now use Sublime Text 2. To read more about why check out the blog post I wrote about my <a href='http://zach.oglesby.co/2012/09/01/SublimeText2.html'>switch</a>.</p>
			<p><a href="http://mutt.org/">Mutt:</a> Mutt with offlineimap is the best email productivity system in the world. While GUI email clients are okay some times, mutt offers the best work flow for me, and keeps me focused on my email.</p>
		
		<h2>Mobile</h2>
			<p><a href="http://astrid.com/">Astrid:</a> Astrid is simply the BEST todo management application I have seen for Android, and now that they have a web interface, it's a complete solution. I tried to use Wunderlist for a while but ended up moving back to Astrid, I personally think it is a better product.</p>
			<p><a href="http://tunein.com/">Tunein Radio:</a> I don't listen to a lot of music, but I have one or two radio stations that I really enjoy, unfortunately after a recent move I am unable to listen to them. Tunein allows me to listen to them on my phone or on my computer.</p>
			<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote:</a> I use Evernote every, it is a part of my brain. If I think I might need to remember something I put it in Evernote. On a side note while there is no official Evernote client for Linux there is an okay third party client that I will use sometimes called <a href='http://nevernote.sourceforge.net/'>Nevernote</a>.</p>
