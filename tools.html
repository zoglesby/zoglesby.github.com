<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, incase you want to know.</p>
	<h1>Bible</h1>
		<h3>Desktop</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.logos.com">Logos:</a> My main desktop Bible study application is Logos Bible Software version 4. This application contains a plethora of information and is comparable to a decent sized library (like a library, many of them I will never use or read). Logos gives me the ability to preform word studies, passage studies, and exegetical studies without having to open and manage a large collection of resources on a physical desk. It also provides a great set of tools for original language study, and while I don't know Greek or Hebrew, Logos has made it all accessible to me. </p>
		<h3>Mobile</h3>
			<p><a href="http://olivetree.com/">Olive Tree Bible Software:</a> While I look forward to Logos releasing their Android application (sometime soon), for the time being I am using Olive Tree daily on my Nexus S to read the bible while I am away. Since I already have a lot invested in Logos products I only have a few items on Olive Tree's platform, but for reading the Bible on Android nothing currently comes close. </p>
			<p><a href="http://www.logos.com/mobile/ipad">Logos for iPad:</a> Logos for the iPad offers by far the BEST mobile solution for me. The 10 inch screen is great for reading and I can store lots of resources on the device for offline reading. Another great feature of the iPad app is that I can view and follow my reading plans on the device so no matter what I am doing I can make sure that I never fall behind reading.</p>
	
	<h1>Others</h1>
		<h3>Web</h3>
			<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote:</a> If I was a Windows user I would probably use OneNote, but as I am a cross platform and Android user, Evernote is the best possible option for me. The service allows me to keeps notes in the form of text, pictures, PDF, and audio. All of this for free or cheap if you are a heavy users.</p>
		
			<p><a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk:</a> I can't possible keep track of all the tasks that I need to accomplish each day, but with RTM I don't have to. The wonderful service keeps track of everything I need to do and can group it in as many was as I could possible imagine. </p>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google. With a price tag of free (or at least the price of using my info for ads), I can't beat what Google has to offer.</p>
		
		<h3>Desktop</h3>
			<p><a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate:</a> As a developer (and DBA) I spend lots of time in a text editor, while emacs is my editor of choice on a remote box, nothing can beat TextMate on the desktop. It a powerhouse complete with users bundles and all kinds of syntax highlighting. Now only if we could get TextMate 2.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical:</a> I love Remember the Milk because of the way it allows you to add TODO items in plain english and it sorts that out. Fantastical makes this same plain english system available on for calendar events on the Mac. Not only is it simple to use it looks nice as well.</p>
