<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, not that I think anyone cares.</p>

		<h2>Computers</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro">Macbook Pro:</a> This is a 2010 13 inch Macbook Pro with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 4GB or ram. It has been my main computer since September 2011. My original plan was to install Fedora on it, but when that failed due to EFI issues I started using OS X full time and now I rather enjoy it.</p>
			<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_S">Nexus S:</a> I am a die hard Android users, and the Nexus S has been a great phone for me. I was using a Nexus One before this, but when I moved back to the US I got a contract with T-Mobile and my Nexus One was using AT&T bands. So rather then suffering with the slow data speeds I upgraded to the Nexus S. As nice as the Galaxy Nexus looks, I think I will have to skip this flagship phone, and that is a first for me. (I was also a G1 owner (the ADP1 to be exact)).</p>
			
		<h2>Web</h2>
			<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote:</a> If I was a Windows user I would probably use OneNote, but as I am a Mac/Linux and Android user, Evernote is the best possible option for me. The service allows me to keeps notes in the form of text, pictures, PDF, and audio. All of this for free or cheap if you are a heavy users. (I also use the application on my phone.)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google.</p>
		
		<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit:</a> Once upon a time I was an Emacs guy, but then I started to use a Mac almost full time. At that point I went back and forth between TextMate and BBEdit, and BBedit won the test. I think it happens to be the best and most complete text editor on the Mac. (We will see what happens if TextMate 2 ever ships.)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.logos.com">Logos Bible Software:</a> This is the best Bible study tool I have ever used. Logos helps from the basic study all the way to getting into Greek and Hebrew, even for a guy like me who knows nothing about these languages. I use to keep a Windows VM on my Linux box for this, but now I am running the Mac application, and this is actually my main reason for going to the Mac. (I also use the application on my phone.)</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow:</a> As a Google Apps user my mail is based on Googles non-standard tags rather then folders. As such I have found that Sparrow is the best client on the Mac to work with my mail.</p>

		<h2>Mobile</h2>
			<p><a href="http://astrid.com/">Astrid:</a> Astrid is simply the BEST todo management application I have seen for Android, and now that they have a web interface, it's a complete solution.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://tunein.com/">Tunein Radio:</a> I don't listen to a lot of music, but I have one or two radio stations that I really enjoy, unfortunately after a recent move I am unable to listen to them. Tunein allows me to listen to them on my phone or on my computer.</p>
