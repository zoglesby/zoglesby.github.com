		<h3>Desktop</h3>
			<p><a href="http://www.logos.com">Logos:</a> My main desktop Bible study application is Logos Bible Software version 4. This application contains a plethora of information and is comparable to a decent sized library (like a library, many of them I will never use or read). Logos gives me the ability to preform word studies, passage studies, and exegetical studies without having to open and manage a large collection of resources on a physical desk. It also provides a great set of tools for original language study, and while I don't know Greek or Hebrew, Logos has made it all accessible to me. </p>

		<h3>Mobile</h3>
			<p><a href="http://olivetree.com/">Olive Tree Bible Software:</a> While I look forward to Logos releasing their Android application (sometime soon), for the time being I am using Olive Tree daily on my Nexus S to read the bible while I am away. Since I already have a lot invested in Logos products I only have a few items on Olive Tree's platform, but for reading the Bible on Android nothing currently comes close. </p>
			<p><a href="http://www.logos.com/mobile/ipad">Logos for iPad:</a> Logos for the iPad offers by far the BEST mobile solution for me. The 10 inch screen is great for reading and I can store lots of resources on the device for offline reading. Another great feature of the iPad app is that I can view and follow my reading plans on the device so no matter what I am doing I can make sure that I never fall behind reading.</p>
