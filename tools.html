<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, incase you want to know.</p>
		<h2>Web</h2>
			<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote:</a> If I was a Windows user I would probably use OneNote, but as I am a cross platform and Android user, Evernote is the best possible option for me. The service allows me to keeps notes in the form of text, pictures, PDF, and audio. All of this for free or cheap if you are a heavy users.</p>
		
			<p><a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk:</a> I can't possible keep track of all the tasks that I need to accomplish each day, but with RTM I don't have to. The wonderful service keeps track of everything I need to do and can group it in as many was as I could possible imagine. </p>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google. With a price tag of free (or at least the price of using my info for ads), I can't beat what Google has to offer.</p>
		
		<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><a href="http://gnu.org/software/emacs">Emacs:</a> Is there another editor? I think not, Emacs is the most complete and advanced editor on the face of the earth. No other application can ever be needed to edit text. EVER!</p>
