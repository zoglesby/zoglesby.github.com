<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>This page covers basic tools that I use every day, incase you want to know.</p>
		<h2>Web</h2>
			<p><a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote:</a> If I was a Windows user I would probably use OneNote, but as I am a cross platform and Android user, Evernote is the best possible option for me. The service allows me to keeps notes in the form of text, pictures, PDF, and audio. All of this for free or cheap if you are a heavy users.</p>
		
			<p><a href="http://rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk:</a> I can't possible keep track of all the tasks that I need to accomplish each day, but with RTM I don't have to. The wonderful service keeps track of everything I need to do and can group it in as many was as I could possible imagine. </p>
		
			<p><a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/group/index.html">Google Apps:</a> I live in the googlesphere, my mail, contacts, rss feeds, calendar, voice mail, and so much more are all handled by Google. With a price tag of free (or at least the price of using my info for ads), I can't beat what Google has to offer.</p>
		
		<h2>Desktop</h2>
			<p><a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate:</a> As a developer (and DBA) I spend lots of time in a text editor, while emacs is my editor of choice on a remote box, nothing can beat TextMate on the desktop. It is a powerhouse, complete with users bundles and all kinds of syntax highlighting. Now only if we could get TextMate 2.</p>
			
			<p><a href="http://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical:</a> I love Remember the Milk because of the way it allows you to add TODO items in plain english and it sorts that out. Fantastical makes this same plain english system available on for calendar events on the Mac. Not only is it simple to use it looks nice as well.</p>
