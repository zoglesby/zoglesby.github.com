title: Gollum Wiki
---

As I continue in my quest to make my website smaller and easier to manage I setup a wiki using [gollum][1], like jekyll it is another [github][2] project that uses ruby and markdown to create great pages. The wiki is actually not like wikipedia in that I am the only person that can edit it and its done by committing to a git repo, but that is what I love about it, no spam and its easy to manage.
