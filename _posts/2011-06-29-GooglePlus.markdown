I started to play with [Google+][1] today and really enjoy it. I think that circles are a great way to only share with people who I want, and thats a huge pull over facebook but while the system is cool the thing that sold me on it was Hangouts. I was able to get a video chat setup between my mother, wife, and myself with no work and we could all talk without any hassle. I am going to try later this week to get a larger group of friends/family on to check it out, but I think this is a *HUGE* win for Google.
