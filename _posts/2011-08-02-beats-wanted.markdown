With the start of every release the docs team has to insure they have the right people
to work on the [Release Notes][1]. Past contributors veryify they still want to help, and spots
open for other members of the community to help fill a vital role in the creation on the release notes.

If you would like to see changes in your favorite part of Fedora hilighted in the release notes
please [sign up][2], and begin hacking away that the wiki page for that section. The best part about it is
that NO knowledge of Docbook is required. Simply edit the wiki page, and talk with developers to make
sure that awsome new features are brought to users attentions and we will do the rest to make sure
that your hard work ends up installed on every new Fedora 16 box.
