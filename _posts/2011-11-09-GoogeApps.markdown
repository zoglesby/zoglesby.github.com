title: Google Apps Migration

----------------

Due to a unfortunate social engineering trick that my wife was taken by, I have been getting lots of spam in my Google email account that will not get processed into my spam folder no matter how many times I mark them as spam. So I decided to move to my Google Apps account full time, it has been something I  have thought about doing it in the past, but figured it would be to much of a pain as I would have to still use my normal account for stuff like Google+ and Voice. 

After migrating I started to do some searching to see if I could move stuff easily, and to my surprise I was able to move just about everything I wanted. [Google Voice][1] and [Picasa Web][2] albums can be migrated with a few clicks of a button, and [everything else][3] was a simple export of data from one account and importing into the other. I am very impressed with Google's openness in this area, while I did not use the Data Liberation Fronts [takeout][4] page to export my data, it is clear that they have made an impact at Google allowing users own their data and move it as they see fit. The only area that I was unable to transfer my data was my Android app purchases, but I did not think that I was going to be able to move them, so I can live with that for now.

Kudos Google, keep up the good work.
