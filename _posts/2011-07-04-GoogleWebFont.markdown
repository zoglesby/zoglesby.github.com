For the past year I have been using [typekit][1] fonts on my websites to give me custom fonts without having to worry about whether or not users have them installed. The issue is that my free one year subscription is almost up and I don't want to pay for fonts on websites that get little to no traffic. 

Enter [Google Web Fonts][2]. Google is providing a great service very similar to typekit that allows you to pick from their list of fonts and use them on your site. All of the fonts are open source, so while you may not get the huge selection that is available on typekit your wallet is a little thicker, and you are a little happier.

P.S. I am not trying to turn this into a Google Evangelist blog, but good services should be pointed out.
