Earlier this year I was at [South East Linux Fest][1] in Charlotte NC, and listened to a talk by Clint Savage ([Herlo][2]) about a new Enterprise Linux rebuild project that he was working on. The goal of the project was to make a more open distro operated very similar to [Fedora][3]. I was intrigued, like most people the giant gap between RHEL 6 and CentOS 6 was frustrating to me; the idea of a community run enterprise distro sounded great.

The question was how can I help? The answer was "What are you good at?" Since [GoOSe][goose] is just getting off the ground they need help all over. Naturally I started working on documentation stuff, but because its a small community the team needed someone with PostgreSQL experience so I started helping with that as well.

What I am doing is not the point of this post. The point I am trying to make is that in a large community like Fedora, it can be hard to find a task that interests you, someone is already packaging your favorite stuff, or people are working on infrastructure you know and it can be intimidating to try and jump in.

GoOSe is a new project and there is plenty of stuff for people to work on. It is also a small group of people working on it at them moment which makes it that much easier to get acquainted and feel comfortable working with the group.

If this sounds interesting to you, or you want to hear more jump in #gooseproject on freenode, or visit the [website][goose]. You can also see source code on [github][4]
